Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK): You'll need JDK installed to compile and run Java programs. You can download it from Oracle's official website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.
A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You'll need a text editor (e.g., Notepad++, Visual Studio Code) or an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) to write and edit Java code.
Compiling the Java Program

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Java program file TestVagrant.java is located using the cd command. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/program
Compile the Java program using the javac command followed by the program's filename. For example:
bash
Copy code
javac TestVagrant.java
If the compilation is successful, this will generate a bytecode file named TestVagrant.java.
Running the Java Program

In the same terminal or command prompt, run the compiled Java program using the java command followed by the class name (excluding the .class extension). For example:
bash
Copy code
java TestVagrant.java
The program's output should now be displayed in the terminal.
Program Usage

Provide any instructions or information about how to use your Java program here. Explain the expected input format, command-line arguments, or user interactions if applicable.

Example

If applicable, provide an example command or sequence of commands to compile and run your Java program, along with the expected output.

bash
Copy code
# Compiling the program
javac YourProgramName.java

# Running the program
TestVagrant.java
Troubleshooting

#Note
you have to enter a value in the prompt.for example 
Enter weekly budget:40(you have to enter value 40)

If you encounter any errors during compilation or execution, double-check the following:

Make sure you have correctly installed the Java Development Kit (JDK).
Verify that you are using the correct commands for compilation (javac) and execution (java).
Ensure that your Java program file has the correct filename and is located in the directory you are working in.
